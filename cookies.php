		<b>About cookies</b><br/><br/>

		Cookies are widely used to allow websites and services to function efficiently. A "cookie" is a small text file that (depending on your browser settings) is deposited on your computer, mobile phone, tablet, or other device, (each, a “device”) when you visit a website. The cookie may be sent back to that site when you visit again, and may then be used by the server to identify and track your use of the website or services.<br/><br/>

		There are two main types of cookies. A “session cookie” is a temporary cookie that only remains in the cookie file of your browser or device until you leave a website. A “persistent” cookie is a long-term cookie that will be stored by your browser or device until its set expiry date (unless you delete it before the expiry date).<br/><br/>
